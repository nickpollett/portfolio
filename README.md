A collection of some of my projects! In order of how interesting I think they are:

**revenue_per_acre_analysis ->** Projects that have an impact are my favourite. This collection of python scripts processes data from the city of Saskatoon to calculate the revenue and expense per acre of every parcel in the city. The resulting visualization has been show all around the city admin, and hopefully can make a change in how we do public accounting. Tech used: Python, later Kepler.gl, but that doesn't really integrate with a GitHub repo.

**collision_calculator ->** A mix of data analysis and web dev, it takes research from the 2018 CRISP report on the cost of collisions and puts it into a website where you can select an area on a map and see how much that area costs every year due to vehicle collisions. Available at saskatooncollisioncalculator.ca

**rfr_call_volume_model.py ->** A ML model I made while working at a business as a side project to predict incoming call volume and sales. Also a version written in R to use the fbProphet model, but I consider myself experienced in Python- not R. Even though this isn't the top item on my list, ML models in Python are my favourite thing to work on, and probably the thing I'm most experienced with. 

**NPP ->** Nick Pollet Photo, my photo/ video website made using a full production workflow including issues/ branches/ hosting on AWS. Available to view at nickpollettphoto.ca. Tech used: JS, React, Tailwind

**webCRM/cmpt-370-project-main ->** Capston group project, a fully featured web CRM for a real estate media company. Tech used: React, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Tailwind

**montecarlo.py ->** A small program that can do monte carlo analysis to find optimal wagers

**folderToCSV.py ->** A simple little python script to take all the names and dates of folders in a directory and turn them into a CSV. Nothing particularly impressive, but shows why I love python. You need something that can do an odd task like that to make accounting for your business easier? You can just crunch it out.
